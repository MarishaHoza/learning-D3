Display bubbles showing the relative usage of words between the NT Bible and the
Bhagivad Gita.

The bubble size should be comparatively mapped between the highest
count word and 0, and should be based on the combined use number.

The bubble position - X should be gravity toward the center line

The bubble position - Y should be scaled on the ratio of use in one book compared
to the other.

The bubble fill should show the relative use of the word in each book, 2 colors

Ideally, I would like to add the following features:

Priority 1: user is able to type in a new word, which will be added to the Display
the word should fall in to place and size. If the word was not used in either,
show a basic grey color, tiny bubble, and position randomly.

Priority 2: select a bubble and the bottom part of the page will display all uses
of the word, paginated with an option to view all or just from 1 book
This would likely require API integration, which I have not implemented yet.
